          <div><img src="img/me-icon-norm.png" alt="Image of Me"></div>
          <div>Hi! I'm Kokoro Nagaya, or Koko. I'm an aspiring artist/designer. I used to live in Taiwan, but after high school, I decided to study
            abroad in the United States. Other then art, I'm also a keen harpist and cook, where I someday hope to go to culinary school as well. I'm also a super
            proud mum to a pomeranian, who goes to university with me in the United States as well!</div>

      <h3>About My Work</h3>
        <div class="aligned">
          <div><img src="img/me-icon-art.png" alt="Image of Art"></div>
          <div>In the past, I primarily did paintings, but I did dabble in sculptures here and there. However, even though I preferred to do work that was more fine art oriented, I
          now prefer to do more design oriented artworks. Currently, I like to do brand design and book design artworks, but I am also open to trying new things such as learning UIUX.</div>

      <h3>Education</h3>
        <div class="aligned">
          <div><img src="img/me-icon-grad.png" alt="Image of Education"></div>
          <div>Before studying abroad, I went to high school in Taiwan, at Taipei European School, where I recieved my International Baccalaureate Diploma.
          I now study in the U.S. for university, at Rhode Island School of Design, for my MFA diploma. In the past, I preferred working with oil paintings, but as I went into university, I started to
          gain a liking to design work. So I decided to major in graphic design in university.</div>
