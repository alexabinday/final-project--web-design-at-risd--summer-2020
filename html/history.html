      Elizabeth Friedlander was born in 1903 to a wealthy family in Germany. She was creatively gifted from a young age, playing piano and violin. She studied typography and calligraphy at the Berlin Academy under ER Weiss. In addition to shaping her quietly refined style, his stature in the industry likely helped her make her way in the male-dominated industry.

      Friedlander’s first job was designing article headings for the prestigious women’s magazine “Die Dame.” She was asked by then-Bauersche Giesserei president Georg Hartmann to design a typeface for the foundry. The typeface she designed was named “Elizabeth-Antiqua,” using her first name instead of her last to avoid the rising Anti-Semitism. A few years into this endeavor, Germany stopped approving Jewish designers’ working licenses, and she lost her job at “Die Dame.” Friedlander had to flee Germany before Elizabeth-Antiqua was finished being cut. She was the first woman to create a commercial Latin typeface.

      She spent a year in Italy, which she fell in love with, before once again having escape the political climate. Like many Jewish women of the time, she was able to find refuge in England on a work visa as a maid. Hartmann, meanwhile, was trying to secure a position for her at the New York branch of Bauersche Giesserei. War broke out before she could make use of her American visa.

      Friedlander ended up spending over a decade in England. She found work at England’s Ministry of Information, in their black propaganda unit, where she forged stamps, ration books, and documents. She seems to have been respected and liked by her coworkers there. Francis Meynell, who helped her secure the position, wrote this poem about her:
    </p>
    <p>Elizabeth</p>
    <p>A stranger still to Death</p>
    <p>Registers in this place</p>
    <p>Her sum of days.</p>
    <p>Although he knows her name</p>
    <p>Death for the life of him</p>
    <p>Cannot recall her face.</p>
    <p>(Alas, her lovely face)</p>
