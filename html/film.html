  <h2>The Film</h2>
  <p>Elizabeth-Antiqua is:</p>
  <p>-a short film</p>
  <p>-a student film</p>
  <p>-an animated film</p>
  <p>-a documentary</p>
  <p>More important than what it is, is what it’s about. Elizabeth-Antiqua is a meticulously researched, meticulously creative recounting of Elizabeth Friedlander’s life.</p>
  <p>You may notice Elizabeth-Antiqua looks a little different than other documentaries. You’re right! Friedlander’s story has been sadly under told and under recorded considering she was the first woman to create a commercial typeface, and she did it while escaping Nazis. Where photographic and video documentation falls short, animation steps in to give our film fresh captivating visuals. Thankfully, what has survived of Friedlander’s story has been preserved in Pauline Paucker’s lovingly crafted book, New Borders: The Working Life of Elizabeth Friedlander. In fact, Pauline herself spoke on the phone with our director to answer our questions about Friedlander!</p>
